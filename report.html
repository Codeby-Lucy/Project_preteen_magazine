            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>This website targets the female pre-teen demographic; age from 9 to 12. Fun, sweet and youthful style of the website with a focus on trendy, seasonal, fantasy topics. The website was created at the end of summer/beginning of autumn with a thought of autumn and winter; therefore, the topics of Back to School, Halloween, and Harry Potter seemed relevant and appropriate.  At it's core, the site's mission is more than just to inform. It aims to inspire, empower, entertain, teach and boost the self-confidence of preteen girls.</p>

            <!-- Question 1 -->
        <section id="question1" >
            <h3>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website.</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> 
                    My 10 year old niece. The inspiration came, when talking with family what theme will I do for my individual work, and niece asked to make it fun so she can read it too. I have asked her about whats trending with 10 year olds these days, what colors she and her classmates like and and so the fun creating this website began.
                </li>
                <li> 
                    Cosy autumn vibes and festivities influenced websites content and aestetics. In today's digital age, the great volume of information can make settling on a specific theme and content for a website quite challenging. Time constraints only increse this challenge, as any alteration on the contents topic or change in aestetics, can cost few days. However, narrowing the focus to a current season and its festivities, addressing trending topics fastened the process and provided clarity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Online fashion and beauty magazines; Since young age I was curious about fashion magazines my mother read. This curiousity grew into passion for style and an interest of designing my own website for young girls to have their own corner of fun trends and tips inspired by online fashion and beauty magazines.

        <section id="question2" >
            <h3>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> 
                    A text alternative for images which can be used by screen readers or when images fail to load.
                </li>
                <li> 
                    Testing colors for accessibility to ensure that content is readable and usable by everyone, including those with vision impairments or color blindness.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Alt text is not valid on videos, so I've implemented aria-label tags with a brief description to screen readers.

            <!-- Question 3 -->
        <section id="question3" >
            <h3>State 3 ways in which you have concidered usability in your site.</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> 
                    <strong>Responsive design</strong> - this website adjusts from bigger desktop screens to mobile device version, which ensures optimal viewing for all users. For example, navigation bar shrinks to the size of a toggle. As learned in the lectures users read from left to right (F pattern) toggle appears on the left side of the site. Other examples are that text from horizontal shrinks to vertical. Cards line up in one column. 
                </li>
                <li> 
                    <strong>Intuititive navigation</strong> - this website festures a clear and easy navigation bar menu, with logical categories of content, which allows users to navigate the website for the information smoothly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Consistent layout</strong> - this website has consistent layout, but still keeps it interesting for the young users. Consistency enables users to quickly familiarize themselves with the website, enhancing overall browsing experience.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        
            <!-- Question 4 -->
        <section id="question4" >
            <h3>State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe how you did that.</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> 
                    I have learned to use Bootstrap framework using w3 and mdbootstrap website (refferences to these resources down below) and various youtube tutorials. I employed templates such as cards (used for certain page layouts), buttons, and the newsletter submission form. Editing these templates demanded a thorough comprehension of the underlying code, so I have delved deep into understanding the structure of the code which enabled me to add additional features with and personalize them with my own CSS styles.
                </li>
                <li> 
                    I have learned to make pop-up modal and flipping cards using Javascript and CSS. Learning Flipping cards were challenging, I spent several days researching what is not working in my JS code (troubleshooting I might add) just to discover that the root issue was my CSS code. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    I have learned to individually decide on the websites aestetics, layout, and content. Additionally, all kind of interactive and attention captivating elements suitable for our little young users; like a spinning button or a hovering table.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Question 5 -->
        <section id="question5" >
            <h3>What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why?</h3>
                <p>Integrating Bootstrap was highly effective and streamlined the design process. The learning was engaging, enabled possibility to add many cool features and modify default style to custom CSS. Bootstrap card layouts are remarkable. They shrink from desktop version to mobile version. This makes the design process both easy and efficient. Moreover, Feature cards and Pop-up Modal also worked well. Such functionalities enhanced the site's interactivity. Feature cards allowed to advertise my own features on the website, pop-up modal ads an interesting visual effect by popping up.</p>
        </section>
        
            <!-- Question 6 -->
        <section id="question6" >
            <h3>What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently 
                another time?</h3>
                <p>Firstly, my work could have been improved if I were allowed a mentor, a professional in the field, to guide me with the overall structure and small bits, which I probably have missed. Secondly, during the finals webinar, the professor mentioned that Bootstrap might not give us enough space to do our own CSS. I truly enjoyed learning Bootstrap. However, to achieve a better grade, I felt the need to integrate my own CSS code. One area of uncertainty was the predefined text sizes in Bootstrap, such as h1 to h6. While my website doesn't use the browser's default text sizes due to Bootstrap's presets, I'm uncertain if examiners expect me to define these elements independently. It's unclear whether demonstrating an understanding of Bootstrap's defaults is sufficient. Lastly, I feel like I could have had better finishing touch on overall website if I had more time. </p>
